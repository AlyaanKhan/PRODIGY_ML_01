## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict the sale price of houses based on specific features. This project is a great example of how machine learning can be applied to real estate analytics to provide valuable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's House Prices competition. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Features

The key features used for predicting house prices are:
- **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area square footage
- **BedroomAbvGr**: Number of bedrooms above basement level
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms

## Model

A linear regression model is used to predict house prices. The model is trained using the scikit-learn library.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd house-price-prediction
```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the script:
```bash
python predict_house_prices.py
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE provides a measure of how accurately the model predicts the house prices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or suggestions.

## Example Output

If you want to see an example of how the predictions work, you can use the following example:

```python
# Example of predicting the price of a new house
new_house = pd.DataFrame({'GrLivArea': [2000], 'BedroomAbvGr': [3], 'FullBath': [2]})
predicted_price = model.predict(new_house)
print(f"Predicted price for the new house: {predicted_price[0]}")
```
